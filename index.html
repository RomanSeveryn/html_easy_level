        <p>
          The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a single-seat, twin-engine,
          all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United
          States Air Force (USAF). The result of the USAF's Advanced Tactical
          Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed primarily as an air
          superiority fighter, but also has ground attack, electronic warfare,
          and signal intelligence capabilities.The prime contractor, Lockheed
          Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and
          conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft
          fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.

          In 1981, the U.S. Air Force identified a requirement for an Advanced
          Tactical Fighter (ATF) to replace the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting
          Falcon. Code named "Senior Sky", this air-superiority fighter program
          was influenced by emerging worldwide threats, including new
          developments in Soviet air defense systems and the proliferation of
          the Su-27 "Flanker"- and MiG-29 "Fulcrum"-class of fighter aircraft.
          It would take advantage of the new technologies in fighter design on
          the horizon, including composite materials, lightweight alloys,
          advanced flight control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and
          most importantly, stealth technology. In 1983, the ATF concept
          development team became the System Program Office (SPO) and managed
          the program at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The demonstration and
          validation (Dem/Val) request for proposals (RFP) was issued in
          September 1985, with requirements placing strong emphasis on stealth
          and supercruise. Of the seven bidding companies, Lockheed and Northrop
          were selected on 31 October 1986. Lockheed teamed with Boeing and
          General Dynamics while Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas, and the
          two contractor teams undertook a 50-month Dem/Val phase, culminating
          in the flight test of two technology demonstrator prototypes, the
          YF-22 and the YF-23, respectively. Concurrently, Pratt & Whitney and
          General Electric were awarded contracts to develop the YF119 and YF120
          respectively for the ATF engine competition.
